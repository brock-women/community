Community standards and general good practices for working with us!

# Community Standards:

1. Ask questions! Open pull requests! Create issues! Github is meant to be a collaborative place of creation. That means, _you_ can bring all of your curiosity, good sense and questions to help create something **even better** than what exists!

2. There's no need to ask permission to do anything in step 1, but you may need to articulate you intention or ideas so we're all on the same page.


More to come. . .(feel free to open a pull request if you want to take a stab at some more!)
